# Hello-World
New guy needs some help
I been trying to get a setup where I can use an Arduino Node-MCU to simple operation that I can send and receive data. The client side is C# using Visual Studio and the server is the Node_MCU. I have a basic system in place but it takes approx. 10 seconds. If I use my firefox browser it takes about a second. Dont understand why the big difference in dealy?
